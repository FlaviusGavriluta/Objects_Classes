# JAVA - Four Pillars

Let's explore more concepts and features that you can add to your program. Here are some ideas
that can help you deepen your understanding of concepts related to objects and classes:

1. **Encapsulation:**

Encapsulation means restricting direct access to some of the object's components and protecting
the object's integrity. In Java, you can do this by declaring the fields as private and providing
public methods to access and modify these fields. These methods are often called "getters" and "setters."
You can make the Pokemon class fields private and add getter and setter methods to access and modify these
fields. This encourages good programming practices.

2. **Inheritance:**

You can introduce a base class, such as Creature, from which Pokemon can inherit. This helps you understand
how inheritance works in OOP. Inheritance allows a class to 'inherit' properties and methods from another class.
This will help us organize the code and share common behavior among different entities. By using inheritance,
we have isolated common properties in a base class and made the code more organized and extensible.
If we decide to add more types of creatures in the future, we can use the Creature class as a base.

3. **Polymorphism:**

You can define different methods for different types of Pokemon. For example, you can create classes for different types of
Pokemon, such as WaterPokemon, that override the attack method.

4. **Interfaces and Abstraction:**

You can define an interface or an abstract class that describes common behaviors for all creatures.

* **Composition:**

You can introduce a new class, such as Trainer, that contains Pokemon. This allows you to explore the relationships
between objects.

* **Additional Methods and Game Logic:**

You can add more game logic, such as tournaments between Pokemon, healing, evolution, etc.

If any of these topics seem interesting to you, I can develop an example and provide a detailed explanation.
Or if you have your own idea or a specific question, I'm happy to help with that!
